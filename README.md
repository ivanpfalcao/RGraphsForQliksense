# RGraphsForQliksense

# Description

  This extension provides 3D visualizations (pie charts, donut charts and bar charts, for now), using the RGraph ( https://www.rgraph.net ) library, for Qliksense. 
  
  
# Manual
  1) Add Dimensions and Measures as usual to the visualization;
  
  2) In Chart Type; you may select the chart type to show;
  
  3) In Appearance -> Chart Labels; you may select if the labels will be shown or not;
  
  4) In Appearance -> Font Size; you may configure the font size of the label;
  
  5) In Apperance -> Label Bold; you may configure if the label will be bold or not (now it works with label sticks);
  
  6) In Pie and Donut settings -> Labels Sticks; you may deactivate the sticks connecting the labels with the charts (pie/donut only);
  
  7) In Pie and Donut settings -> Labels Sticks Default Colors; If activated it will use for the label sticks and the labels the same color of the dimension. If you deactivate it, it will use black;
  
  8) In Pie and Donut settings -> Label Sticks Length; It sets the length of the Label Sticks;
  
  9) In Pie and Donut settings -> Label Sticks Width; It sets the width of the label sticks;
  
  10) In Pie and Donut settings -> 3D-Pie/Donut Radius; It sets the radius (the size) of the Pie/Donut chart;

  11) In Pie and Donut settings -> Exploded Segment Distance; It sets the distance between the chart and the selected slice;
  
  12) In Dimension Layout Configuration -> Dimension Layout; You may configure individually the colors of each dimension:
    - Dimension Name: you will configure the value of the dimension which you will set;
    - Dimension Color: the color of the dimension (hexadecimal);
    
    obs.: You may add as much Dimension configurations as you want. I have already tested with 20 dimensions, but in theory an unlimited number of configurations are possible;
